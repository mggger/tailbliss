# Overview
- **Streamlined Model Training**: Leverage a comprehensive HTTP REST API to facilitate the training of models across various data types.
- **Insightful Data Review**: Access and review your training data to ensure continuous refinement and satisfaction with your model's performance.
- **Custom GPT Integration**: Achieve a custom-tailored chat experience through seamless integration with OpenAI's custom GPT models.
- **User Query Insights**: Engage in ongoing improvement by monitoring and analyzing user queries.

## Streamlined Model Training
### URL Training
Add specific URLs as background knowledge with descriptions to enhance user input matching. For example:
- **Description**: GPT Development Website
- **URL**: https://gptdevelopment.online/

### Text Training
For incorporating large text volumes as background knowledge, descriptions can be added to improve input matching, similar to URL training.

- **Description**: Humorous Text Sample
- **Text**: "Why don't scientists trust atoms anymore? Because they make up everything! This humor mirrors the unpredictability of atoms, much like the unkept promises of my diet plan."
