# How to Fix the "AttributeError: module 'sqlalchemy' has no attribute 'Select'" Error in Python

While working with `Langchain` to read PDF files, you might encounter an error that seems unrelated to the task at hand: an `AttributeError` related to the `sqlalchemy` module. It's intriguing because the operation involves reading PDFs, yet it triggers an error associated with a database operation. Here's a closer look at the issue and how to resolve it.

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/home/git/personal/tools/train_pdf.py", line 3, in <module>
    from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader

    query: Union[str, sa.Select],
AttributeError: module 'sqlalchemy' has no attribute 'Select'. Did you mean: 'select'?
```


## Understanding the Issue

This error message is generated because the `Langchain` library tries to use an attribute from the `sqlalchemy` module that does not exist in the version of `sqlalchemy` you have installed. Specifically, the error is about `sqlalchemy` lacking an attribute called `Select`, suggesting perhaps a mismatch between the library versions or a deprecation issue.

## The Solution

The root of this problem lies in the compatibility between the `Langchain` library and the version of `sqlalchemy`. To resolve this error, you need to ensure that you are using a version of `sqlalchemy` that includes the `Select` attribute. This can typically be achieved by installing a specific version of `sqlalchemy` that is known to be compatible. Here's how you can do it:

```shell
pip3 install sqlalchemy==2.0.0
```
