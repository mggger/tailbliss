# Resolving the "AttributeError: module 'sqlalchemy' has no attribute 'Select'" Error in Python
Experiencing an `AttributeError` while engaging with `Langchain` for PDF parsing signals a misalignment between your `sqlalchemy` installation and `Langchain` expectations. This guide demystifies the error and guides you through the resolution process.


## Understanding the Problem

This error typically indicates that the version of `sqlalchemy` installed does not support the `Select` attribute, which is essential for `Langchain` operations. It's a common instance of library version incompatibility affecting Python projects.



## Step-by-Step Solution

To correct this issue, ensure that `sqlalchemy` is updated to a version that `Langchain` supports, specifically one that encompasses the Select attribute. Use the following command to update `sqlalchemy`:


```python
pip3 install sqlalchemy==2.0.0
```

This aligns the versions, resolving the AttributeError efficiently.


## Proactive Error Handling
While addressing specific attribute errors directly ensures your project's immediate functionality, incorporating a try-except block as a general error handling strategy can enhance your code's robustness and maintainability. This method allows you to gracefully handle potential exceptions, providing a safer runtime environment.
