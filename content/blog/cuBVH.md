# Accelerating 3D Graphics with cuBVH: A CUDA Toolkit Guide

## Understanding cuBVH

cuBVH, or CUDA Mesh Bounding Volume Hierarchy Acceleration Toolkit, marks a significant evolution in 3D graphics and computational geometry. As a library, it supercharges mesh operations using CUDA, NVIDIA's computing platform, enabling swift real-time rendering and physics simulations.

## Quick Start with cuBVH

**Prerequisites**: Ensure eigen, a C++ template library for linear algebra, version 3.3 or higher, is installed. For Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
```

**Installing cuBVH**: Install from GitHub using pip or clone for a local installation:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ashawkey/cubvh
```

Or:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashawkey/cubvh
cd cubvh
pip install .
```

**Troubleshooting**: If encountering missing `eigen/matrix.h`, ensure you're not using incompatible torch versions (2.1.0, 2.1.1).

## Key Operations with cuBVH

cuBVH excels in:
- Building BVH from mesh for rapid operations.
- Executing ray-mesh intersection queries.
- Performing accurate distance queries.

**Example**: For ray tracing a mesh:

```python
import numpy as np
import trimesh
import torch
import cubvh

# Load mesh and create BVH
mesh = trimesh.load('example.ply')
BVH = cubvh.cuBVH(mesh.vertices, mesh.faces)

# Setup rays and perform ray tracing
rays_o, rays_d = get_ray(pose, intrinsics, H, W)
intersections, face_id, depth = BVH.ray_trace(rays_o, rays_d)
```

## Why cuBVH Matters

cuBVH stands out for its ability to manage complex 3D mesh operations with unmatched speed, making real-time rendering and simulations more accessible.

## Credits and Future of cuBVH

Inspired by Thomas MÃ¼ller's projects, cuBVH continues to evolve, showcasing the collective progress in computational graphics and simulations. It's positioned to be an essential tool for developers in 3D graphics and computational geometry.
