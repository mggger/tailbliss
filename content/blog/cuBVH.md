# Exploring cuBVH: A CUDA Mesh BVH Acceleration Toolkit

## Introduction to cuBVH

The world of 3D graphics and computational geometry is ever-evolving, and with the advent of cuBVH, it takes another significant leap. cuBVH stands for CUDA Mesh Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) Acceleration Toolkit, a highly specialized library designed to enhance and accelerate mesh operations using CUDA, NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model. This toolkit is pivotal for developers working with complex 3D models, providing them with the means to achieve real-time rendering and physics simulations by efficiently handling mesh-related calculations.

## Installation and Setup

To integrate cuBVH into your projects, it's essential to ensure that you have eigen, a C++ template library for linear algebra, version 3.3 or higher installed. This dependency is crucial for cuBVH's operation. Installation on Ubuntu systems can be accomplished with a simple package manager command:

```bash
sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
```

After setting up the prerequisites, cuBVH can be installed directly from its GitHub repository using pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ashawkey/cubvh

```

Alternatively, for a local setup, clone the repository and install the toolkit as follows:

```python
git clone https://github.com/ashawkey/cubvh
cd cubvh
pip install .
```

## Troubleshooting Installation

A common issue encountered during installation relates to missing eigen files, particularly `eigen/matrix.h`. This problem is primarily associated with specific versions of torch (2.1.0 and 2.1.1) and can be circumvented by avoiding these versions.

## Usage and Capabilities
cuBVH simplifies and accelerates several key operations essential for 3D graphics and physics simulations:

- **Building BVH from Mesh**: Convert your mesh into a BVH structure for faster operations, crucial for real-time applications.

- **Ray-Mesh Intersection Queries**: Determine the intersection points of rays with a mesh, a fundamental operation in rendering and physics simulations.

- **Distance Queries**: Measure the unsigned and signed distances from points to the nearest mesh surface, useful for collision detection and simulation accuracy.

An example usage scenario involves ray tracing to render a mesh, highlighting cuBVH's ability to efficiently handle complex calculations necessary for realistic rendering:
```python
import numpy as np
import trimesh
import torch
import cubvh

mesh = trimesh.load('example.ply')
BVH = cubvh.cuBVH(mesh.vertices, mesh.faces)
rays_o, rays_d = get_ray(pose, intrinsics, H, W)
intersections, face_id, depth = BVH.ray_trace(rays_o, rays_d)
```

## The Significance of cuBVH
cuBVH represents a significant advancement in the field of 3D graphics and computational geometry, offering developers a powerful tool to handle complex mesh operations with unprecedented efficiency. By leveraging the capabilities of CUDA, cuBVH enables real-time rendering and physics simulations that were previously out of reach for many applications.
